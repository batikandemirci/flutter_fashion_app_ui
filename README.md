New Flutter Fashion App UI

Using the power of Flutter and my own skills, I created a new fashion app interface design that offers a modern and user-friendly interface where users can easily discover and buy clothes.

I used Flutter's Material Design library to create this design. Material Design is a consistent design system designed to ensure that users get the best experience. Thanks to this design system, users will have a similar experience to other Flutter apps when using this app.

I also used Flutter's animation features to create this design. Animations make it more fun and interesting for users to interact with the app.

I'm proud of the time and effort I put into creating this design, and I hope it helps make fashion apps more user-friendly and attractive.

I'm also open to feedback and suggestions. If you have any ideas on how I can improve the design, please feel free to leave a comment on the GitHub repo.
